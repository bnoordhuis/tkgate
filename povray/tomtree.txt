The tomtree.zip archive contains:
___________________________________________________________________________

TOMTREE.inc
	This is the generator. After copying it into your include-file path 
	there is no reason to touch it. The settings will be made in seperate 
	inc-files for each different trees.
	
TOMLEAF.inc
	Here are some leaves, simple leaves and better height_field leaves.
	To keep tomtree.zip quite small I've added only a few variations of 
	one typical HF-leaf and one HF-blossom.

TESTTREE.inc
	This is a settINC to try, watch and learn what happens after changing 
	the values. Now the values make a very straight, rather empty tree for 
	better observation what's going on. 
	
BIRCH.inc
	An example settINC.

OLIVE.inc
	Another example settINC.

PALM.inc
	A third example settINC. 

TREE.pov
	A simple scene file to show how to use TomTree in your scene.
	If you want trees of DIFFERENT kind in your scene you should add 
	both, the other settINC and - again - tomtree.inc. 
	(The camera is adjusted in a ratio of 1 to 1)

LEAF.tga
	Source-image for the HF-leaves in tomleaf.inc.

LEAF.gif
	Source-image for the texture for the leaves "...LEAF_tex".
	If you use these own-textured leaves the global "FOLIAGE_COLOR" shows 
	no effect and each leaf has the same texture.

LEAFx.tga
	This is the source-image for cutting out the HF-leaf in a natural shape.

BLOSSOM.tga
	Source-image for the HF-blossoms in tomleaf.inc.

tomtree.txt
	This file. Below I will try to explain each option of the settINCs.

TRIAL OF AN EXPLANATION
__________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________

Tomtrees have a
 
	TRUNK
	ROOTS at the trunk,
	BRANCHES at the trunk,
	TWIGS at the branches,
	BUNCHES at the twigs, and these bunches are made of 
	TWIG_RAMIFICATION, 
	LEAVES and
	BLOSSOMS. 
	
Although the TWIG_RAMIFICATION belongs structural to the wooden part of 
the tree it will be handled with the bunch, like the leaves. Each bunch has 
one TWIG_RAMIFICATION. 

The long measures of the parts of the tree are in relationship to each other.
So, I recommend you think about a real tree with its real longmeasures and set the 
values perhaps in centimeter so the unit is good for the leaves as well as for the 
whole tree. Regardless of the unit you will choose, TomTree scales down every tree 
to 1 unit at the end of calculation, so that in your scenefile you can scale it up 
to your request.


About the options:
__________________

___________________________________________________________________________________
// T R E E
___________________________________________________________________________________

BRANCHES
	Set the number of all branches at the tree. 

TWIGS
	Set the number for the twigs at a branch; multiplied by the number of branches 
	results in all twigs at the tree. 

BUNCHES
	Set the number for the bunches at a twig; multiplied by all twigs results in all 
	bunches at the tree. 

LEAVES
	Set the number for the leaves in a bunch; multiplied by all bunches results in 
	all leaves at the tree.

BLOSSOMS
	Set the number for the blossoms in a bunch; multiplied by all bunches results in 
	all blossoms at the tree. 
ROOTS
	Set the number of all roots at the tree. 

BRANCH_RANDOM
	Any different value results in a different branch-arrangement of the same kind of 
	tree.

TWIG_RANDOM
	And if you are not satisfied with the arrangement of twigs at the branch, play here. 

ROOT_RANDOM
	The same possibility for the roots.

// T R U N K
	(Mathematical trunk-length:
	FIRST_BRANCH_AT_TRUNK + BRANCH_AREA_AT_TRUNK + mathematical branch-length)
___________________________________________________________________________________

TRUNK_RADIUS
	This, of course, is the radius of the trunk to determine its thickness. 

TRUNK_STRENGTH
	Decreasing this value saves parsingtime, increasing is needed if the trunk 
	falls in pieces (in the case of very long trunk or/and very wide bend). 
	It's a factor and 1 is a normal value.

TRUNK_BEND_X
TRUNK_BEND_Z
	In connection with the following TRUNK_CURVE and TRUNK_SNAG with their 
	frequencies you have the chance of interlocked, irregular forming of the 
	trunk. Play with their combinations.
	There are seperate values for the trunk-bend in the two lateral directions (X,Z). 
	TRUNK_BEND_X/Z gives the width of the outer bend of the trunk, probably with 
	about 1 or 2 archs (TRUNK_BEND_X/Z_FREQUENCY). TRUNK_BEND_X/Z has usually a higher 
	value than TRUNK_CURVE, and TRUNK_CURVE is usually wider than TRUNK_SNAG. 
	Then, by the way of contrast, TRUNK_BEND_X/Z_FREQUENCY should be smaller than 
	the TRUNK_CURVE_FREQUENCY, which should be smaller than TRUNK_SNAG_FREQUENCY.

TRUNK_BEND_X_FREQUENCY
TRUNK_BEND_Z_FREQUENCY
	I have mentioned, TRUNK_BEND_X/Z_FREQUENCY is the number of outer arches of the 
	trunk. You may set different values for the two lateral directions. 

TRUNK_CURVE
	It's the width of the inner bend of the trunk. Inside the outer bend, you 
	have set with TRUNK_BEND_X/Z, you have a higher number (TRUNK_CURVE_FREQUENCY) 
	of inner curve. 

TRUNK_CURVE_FREQUENCY
	Here you set the number of inner curves of the trunk. 

TRUNK_SNAG
	Inside the inner bend, here you set the width for the smallest bend, the snag. 

TRUNK_SNAG_FREQUENCY
	And the number of snags in the trunk. 

TRUNK_SPIRAL
	Additional to the bend of the trunk it's angle-value for a corkscrew 
	looking trunk. 360 = one turn. 

TRUNK_TAPER
	Here you adjust how much the trunk tapers off towards its top-end.
	Example: 0 = trunk-top has the same thickness as the trunk-base. 
	1 = the trunk-top-end has no thickness and this is the mathematical top-end 
	of the whole tree. Nevertheless the trunk is cut at the highest branch. 
 
FIRST_BRANCH_AT_TRUNK
	This is the distance from the base of the trunk (the ground) to the 
	lowest/first branch at the tree. 

BRANCH_AREA_AT_TRUNK
	This is the distance between the lowest/first and the highest/last branch 
	at the trunk.

__________________________________________________________________________________
// B R A N C H
	(Mathematical branch-length:
	FIRST_TWIG_AT_BRANCH + TWIG_AREA_AT_BRANCH + mathematical twig-length)
___________________________________________________________________________________

BRANCH_THICKNESS_CHANGE
	The thickness of the branch depends on the thickness of the trunk, 
	given by TRUNK_RADIUS. 
	Here you can adjust the branch-thickness. It's a factor, so, 1 means that 
	the branch-base has the same thickness as the trunk at this point.

BRANCH_STRENGTH
	As for the trunk, decreasing this value saves parsingtime, increasing is 
	needed if the branches fall in pieces (in the case of very long branches 
	or/and very wide bend). It's a factor and 1 is a normal value. 
	0 makes the branches invisable (unlike to the BRANCH_NUMBER, 0 doesn't 
	switch off following twigs, bunches and leaves).

BRANCH_BEND
	In connection with the following BRANCH_CURVE and BRANCH_SNAG with their 
	frequencies you have the chance of interlocked, irregular forming of your 
	branches. Play with their combinations. 
	BRANCH_BEND gives the width of the outer bend of the branch, probably with 
	about 1 or 2 archs (BRANCH_BEND_FREQUENCY). BRANCH_BEND has usually a higher 
	value than BRANCH_CURVE, and BRANCH_CURVE is usually wider than BRANCH_SNAG. 
	Then, by the way of contrast, BRANCH_BEND_FREQUENCY should be smaller than 
	the BRANCH_CURVE_FREQUENCY, which should be smaller than BRANCH_SNAG_FREQUENCY. 

BRANCH_BEND_FREQUENCY
	I have mentioned, BRANCH_BEND_FREQUENCY is the number of outer arches of the 
	branch. 

HORIZONTAL_BRANCH_BEND_SWITCH
	Switch off (0) the main horizontal bend if you only want a vertical bend (perhaps 
	the branch should grow at a wall). 
	Otherwise the value is 1. Nevertheless other values are possible. For example, 
	if you set 1.5, the horizontal bend is 50 percent wider than the vertical bend. 

EXTRA_NOISE_SWITCH
	Default is 1; Sometimes it's annoying, if you need more regular arcs in the branch,
	for example at the palmtree in PALM.inc. In this case set the value to 0 in order 
	to switch this additional noise off. It only affects the BRANCH_BEND and twig-bend.

BRANCH_CURVE
	It's the width of the inner bend of the branch. Inside the outer bend (BRANCH_BEND), 
	you have a higher number (BRANCH_CURVE_FREQUENCY) of inner curve. 

BRANCH_CURVE_FREQUENCY
	Here you set the number of inner curves of the branch, as I've said above. 

HORIZONTAL_BRANCH_CURVE_SWITCH
	Like the HORIZONTAL_BRANCH_BEND_SWITCH 0 switches off the horizontal curve.

BRANCH_LONGITUDINAL_CURVE
	An additional value for less or more lengthwise branch-irregularity. 
	Examples: 0 = no lengthwise curve; 1=equal to lateral direction. 

BRANCH_SNAG
	It's the width for the innermost bend of the branch. Inside the inner bend, 
	here you set the width for the smallest bend, the snag. 

BRANCH_SNAG_FREQUENCY
	And, of course, the number of snags at the branch. 

BRANCH_REDUCTION
	Towards the top of the tree usually the branches become smaller. Here is 
	the value to adjust this. Examples: 0 = no reduction; 0.5 = the highest 
	branch at the tree has about the half size from the lowest. The twigs and bunches 
	of the branch will be reduced too towards the top of tree. 
	If you want that the bunches with their leaves keep their size you can set 
	a corresponding negative value for BUNCH_TAPER_OF_AT_TREE. 

BRANCH_TAPER
	Here you adjust how much the branch tapers off towards its end.
	Example: 0 = branch-end has the same thickness as the branch-base. 
	1 = the branch-end has no thickness. 
	The twigs and bunches of the branch will be reduced towards the branch-end too. 
	If you want that the bunches with their leaves keep their size you can set 
	a corresponding negative value for BUNCH_TAPER_OF_AT_BRANCH. 

BRANCH_END_EQUALIZER
	It's not noticable if the TWIG_THICKNESS (TWIG_THICKNESS_CHANGE) is set to 
	the same value as the BRANCH_THICKNESS. But if the twigs are set to be more 
	thin than the branches and you set the BRANCH_END_EQUALIZER to 1 the branch will 
	adapt to the same thickness as the last twig towards the end of the branch. 
	This feature only works if the following BRANCH_TIP is 0.

BRANCH_TIP
	BRANCH_TIP adjusts how long the branch will be continued after its last twig. 
	For example, 0 means that the branch ends at its last/outermost twig 
	(with the thickness of this twig). 1 = the branch ends at its mathematical end. 

BRANCH_TURN_SWITCH
	To switch on (1) or off (0) the random rotation of the branch around its 
	longitudinal axis. 

BRANCH_ALTERNATE_SWITCH
	To switch on (1) the reciprocal position of the branches at the trunk.
	If it's set to 0, the branches rotate randomly around the trunk.

BRANCH_SPIRAL
	Additional to the bend of the branch it's angle-value for a corkscrew 
	looking branch. 360 = one turn.

BRANCH_ANGLE
	This is the start-angle for the first/lowest branch at the trunk. 
	0 means that the lowest branch arises from the trunk in horizontal direction. 
	Values greater than 0 result in upwards inclination.

BRANCH_ANGLE_SCOPE
	For more irregularity this is a random oscillation-scope (angle) for 
	each branch.

BRANCH_ALIGNMENT
	After setting the angle for the lowest/first branch at the tree normally 
	the branches towards the top of the tree align with the trunk (value = 1).
	Here you can change this alignment. For example 0 means, that there is no 
	alignment and all branches have the same angle as the lowest branch.

STRAIGHTEN_TOWARDS_TOP
	IF you have set a bend for your branches, but want to straighten them towards 
	the top of the tree increase this value. 0 = no straightening; 1 = the highest 
	branch is straight.

FIRST_TWIG_AT_BRANCH
	This is the distance from the branch-base at the trunk to the first twig at the 
	branch.

TWIG_AREA_AT_THE_BRANCH
	The distance between the first and the last twig at the branch. 

___________________________________________________________________________________
// T W I G
	(Mathematical twig-length:
	FIRST_BUNCH_AT_TWIG + BUNCH_AREA_AT_TWIG + mathematical bunch-length)
___________________________________________________________________________________
	
TWIG_STRENGTH
	The normal value is 1. 
	If you have many twigs and want to decrease parsingtime you may try to decrease 
	this value until the twigs fall in pieces.
	If you have very long twigs, and therefore the twigs fall in pieces, 
	than increase the value for TWIG_STRENGTH (increases parsingtime too).
	If you don't need twigs but want to have leaves, set this value to 0.

TWIG_THICKNESS_CHANGE
	The thickness of the twig depends on the thickness of the branch (the 
	branch-thickness itself depends on the TRUNK_RADIUS). Here you can change the 
	thickness of the twig with a factor.
	So, 1 = the base of the twig has the same thickness as the branch at this point.
	0.5 = the base of the twig has the half of the size as the branch at this point.

HORIZONTAL_TWIG_ANGLE
	It's the angle of the twig to the branch in horizontal direction.

VERTICAL_TWIG_ANGLE
	And for the vertical direction.

HORIZONTAL_TWIG_ANGLE_SCOPE
	In addition to the HORIZONTAL_TWIG_ANGLE this is a scope for a 
	random oscillation of the angle for each twig at the branch.

VERTICAL_TWIG_ANGLE_SCOPE
	And the scope for the VERTICAL_TWIG_ANGLE.

HORIZONTAL_TWIG_ALIGNMENT
	If it is 0, than all twigs at the branch keep the angle which is determined 
	by the HORIZONTAL_TWIG_ANGLE.
	If it is 1 for example, than this angle decreases with each twig towards the branch-end
	and the last twig at the branch is aligned with the branch.
	
VERTICAL_TWIG_ALIGNMENT
	And the same for the vertical direction.

TWIG_TURN_SWITCH
	To switch on (1) or off (0) the random rotation of the twig around its own 
	longitudinal axis. 

TWIG_ALTERNATE_SWITCH
	If it's 0, than the twigs rotate automatically around the branch in a random 
	manner.
	If it's 1, the twigs have a reciprocal horizontal direction with the given 
	HORIZONTAL_ and VERTICAL_TWIG_ANGLE (like the leaves at the palmtree). 

TWIG_CURVE_ADJUSTMENT
	The bend, curve and snag of the twigs depend on the bend, curve and snag of the 
	branches. Here you can increase or decrease it for the twigs.
	1 = the same bend, curve and snag as for the branches.
	0 = straight twigs.

TWIG_CURVE_FREQUENCY_ADJUSTMENT
	To adjust the number of bends, curves and snags at the twig which depends on 
	the branch. 
	1 = the same number of bends curves and snags at the twig.

TWIG_TAPER
	1 is the default and the twig ends in a tip.
	The lower this value the thicker the twig-end will be.
	With 0 you get the same thickness at the start and end of the twigs (what for?)
 
TWIG_TIP
	Here you can lengthen or shorten the twig after the last bunch at the twig. 
	0 = the twig ends at the last bunch-base.
	Up to 1, which lengthen the twig up to the outermost leaf. 

STRAIGHTEN_TOWARDS_BRANCH_END
	Like the STRAIGHTEN_TOWARDS_TOP for the branches it's the straightening of the 
	twigs towards each branch-end.
		
TWIG_RAMIFICATION_ORDER
	Here you may set an additional ramification. It's a repetition of the 
	twig (1. order), which may have a repetition itself (2. order) and a repetition 
	at the repetition at the repetition (3. order) at the twigs. 
	The size, orientation and quantity will be controlled by the bunches.
	There are 4 possible values for TWIG_RAMIFICATION_ORDER:
	0 = no additional twig-ramification;
	1 = each bunch gets a twig-ramification of 1. order (a twig-repetition) 
	at the twig.
	2 = each bunch gets a twig-ramification of 2. order at the twig.
	3 = each bunch gets a twig-ramification of 3. order at the twig.
	(To create a very ramified tree doesn't need too much parsingtime because it doesn't 
	need too many original branches and twigs to be calculated.)

LAST_RAMIFICATION_NUMBER
	It's the number of 2.order-twig-ramifications at the 1.order-twig-ramification 
	and also the number of 3.order-twig-ramis at each 2.order-twig-rami. 
	So, for example, it is set to 4, than you have for each bunch one 1.order-rami, 
	four 2.order-ramis and sixteen 3.order-ramis.

TWIG_RAMIFICATION_THICKNESS_CHANGE
	Because the size of the twig-ramifications is controlled by the bunches it may be 
	that the thickness of the twig-ramification must be adjusted here. It's a factor, 
	so, 1 means no change of the thickness.

TWIG_RAMIFICATION_CURVE_ADJUSTMENT
	This is for the ramis, the same as for the twigs with TWIG_CURVE_ADJUSTMENT.								

RAMI_CURVE_FREQUENCY_ADJUSTMENT
	This is for the ramis, the same as for the twigs with TWIG_CURVE_FREQUENCY_ADJUSTMENT. 

TWIG_RAMIFICATION_STRENGTH
	To save parsingtime decrease this value until the twig-ramification falls in pieces.
	If the twig-ramification falls in pieces increase this value.
	(Like for the twigs with TWIG_STRENGTH, for the branches with BRANCH_STRENGTH, 
	for the trunk with TRUNK_STRENGTH and for the roots with ROOT_STRENGTH.) 

FIRST_BUNCH_AT_TWIG
	This is the distance from the base of the twig at the branch to the first bunch 
	at the twig.

BUNCH_AREA_AT_TWIG
	This is the distance between the first and last bunch at the twig.

___________________________________________________________________________________
// B U N C H
	Unlike the trunk, the root, the branch, the twig, the twig-ramification, 
	the leaf or blossom the bunch is not a real element of the tree but only a 
	combination of one twig-ramification and a partial quantity of the leaves and 
	blossoms.
	(Mathematical bunch-length:
	BUNCH_MAJOR_RADIUS + BUNCH_MINOR_RADIUS + leaf-length)
___________________________________________________________________________________

BUNCH_MAJOR_RADIUS
	This is the distance from the bunch-base at the twig to the innermost leaf in 
	the bunch.

BUNCH_MINOR_RADIUS
	This is the distance between the innermost and outermost leaf in the bunch.

HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_FUNNEL
	The bunch fans out up to this angle (degree) in horizontal direction.

VERTICAL_BUNCH_FUNNEL
	And the oscillation between this angle in vertical direction.

ROTATION_BUNCH_FUNNEL
	If you set here an angle (degree) greater than 0 the HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_FUNNEL 
	and the VERTICAL_BUNCH_FUNNEL will be switched off and the leaves will turned 
	around the longitudinal bunch-axis after the bunch fans out up to the given angle. 
	So, for example if a value of 180 is set the leaves in the bunch describe a half-
	sphere. In this funneltype the leaves are placed in concentrical direction. Unlike 
	this the HORIZONTAL_ and VERTICAL_BUNCH_FUNNEL lets fan out the leaves by keeping 
	the direction of each leaf.

	(All three funnels determine, how much the twig-ramification will be spread out)

HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ANGLE
	The horizontal fixed angle of the first bunch at the twig to the twig. 

VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE
	The vertical fixed angle of the first bunch at the twig to the twig.
	(Remember, the bunch contains the twig-ramification, so, it's the inclination-angle 
	for the twig-ramification too.)

HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ANGLE_SCOPE
	This is the oscillation scope as addition to the HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ANGLE for 
	more irregularity among the bunches.

VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE_SCOPE
	And the additional oscillation scope for the VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE.

BUNCH_TURN_SWITCH
	To switch on (1) or off (0) the rotation of the bunch around the twig after the 
	HORIZONTAL_ and/or VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE. Each bunch has its own random 
	value of rotation around the twig.

BUNCH_TURN_SHIFT
	Although the bunches will turn around the twig after the BUNCH_TURN_SWITCH is on (1),
	the BUNCH_TURN_SHIFT determines if the leaves keep their upside up (1) or not (0).

BUNCH_ALTERNATE_SWITCH
	In addition to the fixed HORIZONTAL_ and VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE you can 
	switch on (1) or off (0) the reciprocal directions of the bunches (like the 
	leaves at the palmtree; in this example each bunch has one leaf).

HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ALIGNMENT
	If this value is set to 0 each bunch at the twig hold the angle to the twig 
	you have set with the HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ANGLE. 
	If it is set to 1 the bunches decrease their angle to the twig towards the twig-end, 
	so that the last bunch at the twig is aligned with the twig. You may use other 
	values. Perhaps you have a HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ANGLE of 90 (degrees) and set the 
	HORIZONTAL_BUNCH_ALIGNMENT to 0.5 the last bunch at the twig has an angle of 45° 
	towards the twig.

VERTICAL_BUNCH_ALIGNMENT
	The same for the VERTICAL_BUNCH_ANGLE and the alignment towards twig.

BUNCH_TAPER_OFF_AT_TWIG
	This makes the bunches smaller towards the twig-end if the value is greater than 0.
	0 = same size for all bunches at the twig.
	0.5 = the last bunch at the twig has the half size of the first one.
	1 = the size of the last bunch at the twig goes to 0.

BUNCH_TAPER_OFF_AT_BRANCH
	The same for the size-reduction of the bunches at the branch towards the branch-end.
	This has no effect to the twigs and branches, so it's often better to adjust the 
	taper-off at the branches with BRANCH_TAPER. Than you have the possibility to set 
	a negative value for the balance against the BRANCH_TAPER.

BUNCH_TAPER_OFF_AT_TREE
	And, of course, the same for the size-reduction of the bunches towards the top of 
	the tree.
	This has no effect to the twigs and branches, so it's often better to adjust the 
	taper-off at the tree with BRANCH_REDUCTION. Than you have the possibility to set 
	a negative value for the balance against the BRANCH_REDUCTION.

BUNCH_ARC_AT_TWIG
	Normally tomtree lets shrink the bunches towards the twig-end in a linear manner.
	BUNCH_ARC_AT_TWIG is an additional factor of the given size value (BUNCH_MAJOR_RADIUS+
	BUNCH_MINOR_RADIUS+LEAF_LENGTH) in x,y,z direction.
	If BUNCH_ARC_AT_TWIG is <0,0,0> there is no change. <2,0.5,1> for example says that 
	the innermost bunch at the twig starts with the given size, then towards the middle 
	of the BUNCH_AREA_AT_TWIG the bunch-size increases to the triple length (x), 
	is 1.5 times higher (y), and has the double size of breadth. 
	Then, the outermost bunch at the twig has the given size again with its normal 
	shrinking.

BUNCH_ARC_AT_BRANCH
	The same for the non-linear size-changing of the bunches along the branch.

BUNCH_DEFORM
	I'm not sure if this is a real useful point?!
	It's for an additional distortion of the whole bunch. The values for the 
	<x,y,z>-factor (the longitudinal bunch-axis is the x-axis).
	But the leaves, blossoms and twig-ramification will be distorted too. Up to now 
	I've never used it.

#include "TOMLEAF.INC"
	This is the source for the LEAF_TYPE. In TOMLEAF.INC are some simple leaves 
	and some variations of a height_field leaf and a height_field blossom. I 
	preferr the HF-leaves(blossoms), because of much more realistic shape without 
	increasing parsing- and rendertime too much. If the amount of leaves goes 
	beyond your RAMsize you better select a non-CSG leaftype.
	Of course, TOMLEAF.inc contains only a few examples in order to keep the 
	downloadsize of TOMTREE.zip rather small. 
	
LEAF_TYPE
	The name of the leaf you have specified in your (TOM)LEAF.INC above.

LEAF_LENGTH
	I have said it, I think it's the best way to think in real-life measure like cm.
	So a typical LEAF_LENGTH could be 10 (cm). There is a built-in scope of length. 

LEAF_BREADTH
	The width of the leaf, with a built-in scope.

LEAF_HEIGHT
	It means the height of the arch the leaves describe. For normal leaves it may be 
	not too high, but palmleaves for example should be not so straight.

MAX_LEAF_TILT
	For the swinging irregularity of the leaves at the tree I have built in an 
	oscillation. MAX_LEAF_TILT means this oscillation of turn around the 
	longitudinal leaf-axis. 

MAX_LEAF_TURN
	The same for the oscillation of turn around the axis of leaf-height. 

LEAF_INCLINATION
	Before you set the oscillation of leaves around the lateral axis in the next 
	point (MAX_INCLINATION_SCOPE) here you can set a fixed inclination, a turn around the 
	lateral axis of the leaves or inclination to the longitudinal axis 
	(perhaps you want all leaves in a bunch are hanging down).

MAX_INCLINATION_SCOPE
	And, as I said, the oscillation of inclination added to the fixed inclination.

__________________________________________________________________________________
// B L O S S O M
___________________________________________________________________________________

BLOSSOM
	The name of blossom you find in TOMLEAF.INC or your own LEAF.INCs.

BLOSSOM_LENGTH
	Or height; the length of the blossom along its longitudinal axis.

BLOSSOM_WIDTH
	This is the value for the lateral extension.

BLOSSOM_INCLINATION
	Like the LEAF_INCLINATION it's a fixed inclination to the longitudinal 
	axis.

BLOSSOM_COLOR
	Set the RGB-values for your blossoms (perhaps there will be a better texturing 
	in the future).

FIRST_ROOT_AT_TRUNK
	This is the distance from the trunk-base (the ground) to the uppermost root 
	at the trunk. 

ROOT_LENGTH
	Unlike the twig, branch, trunk the root mustn't show consideration for any 
	ramification and therefore you can set directly a length for the root.  

ROOT_THICKNESS_CHANGE
	The root-thickness depends on the thickness of the trunk, which is determined 
	with the TRUNK_RADIUS. With ROOT_THICKNESS_CHANGE as a factor you adjust the 
	root-thickness.
	So, 1 means that the root has at its base the same thickness as the trunk at 
	this point. Or, for example, 0.5 = half thickness of the trunk.

ROOT_STRENGTH
	As for the twigs(-ramis), branches and trunk, decreasing this value saves parsingtime, 
	increasing is needed if the roots fall in pieces (in the case of very long roots 
	or/and very wide bend). It's a factor and 1 is a normal value. 
	0 switches off the roots.

ROOT_BEND
	And once more again:
	In connection with the following ROOT_CURVE and ROOT_SNAG and their frequencies 
	you have the chance of interlocked, irregular forming of your roots. Play with the
	combinations. 
	ROOT_BEND gives the width of the outer bend of the root, probably with 
	about 1 or 2 archs (ROOT_BEND_FREQUENCY). ROOT_BEND has usually a higher 
	value than ROOT_CURVE which has usually a higher value than ROOT_SNAG. 
	Then, by the way of contrast, ROOT_BEND_FREQUENCY should be smaller than the 
	ROOT_CURVE_FREQUENCY,... 

ROOT_BEND_FREQUENCY
	It's the number of outer arches of the root.

ROOT_CURVE
	It's the width of the inner bend of the root. 

ROOT_CURVE_FREQUENCY
	It's the number of inner arches of the root. 

ROOT_SNAG
	Inside the inner bend, here you set the width for the innermost bend, the snag. 

ROOT_SNAG_FREQUENCY
	And the number of snags in the root.

ROOT_TURN_SWITCH
	To switch on (1) or off (0) the random rotation of each root around its own 
	longitudinal axis. 

ROOT_ANGLE
	This is the start-angle for the first/highest root at the trunk. 
	0 means that the first/highest root arises from the trunk in horizontal direction. 
	Values greater than 0 result in downwards inclination. 

ROOT_ALIGNMENT
	If it is 0, than all roots have the same angle as it is determined 
	by the ROOT_ANGLE.
	If it is 1 for example, than the last/lowest root points vertical downwards.

SUNKEN_TRUNK_COLOR
RAISED_TRUNK_COLOR
	To simulate the bark, here you have two colors, may be light and dark. 
	For example, for the bark of a birch (it's more a grain than a bark) it 
	could be <1,1,1> and <0,0,0>.

FOLIAGE_COLOR_AT_BRANCH_END
	If this point is switched on (1), the color of the bark (determined through the 
	previous points) changes smoothly into the FOLIAGECOLOR towards the branch-end.
	Where the transition happens is determined with the following HORIZONTAL- and 
	VERTICAL_SCAR_SHRINKING. 

TRUNK_SCAR_WIDTH
TRUNK_SCAR_HEIGHT
	Typically the bark has a vertical direction, so the value for TRUNK_SCAR_HEIGHT 
	is greater than the value for TRUNK_SCAR_WIDTH. But if we look at the grain of 
	the birch again it shows a horizontal direction with the higher value for the 
	TRUNK_SCAR_WIDTH.

HORIZONTAL_SCAR_SHRINKING	
	I have built in an automatically shrinking of the scar outwards to the whole tree. 
	So the values for TRUNK_SCAR_WIDTH and TRUNK_SCAR_HEIGHT are mainly for the trunk. 
	Towards the branchends the scar becomes smaller and smaller. 
	This shrinking area discribes an halfsphere if HORIZONTAL_SCAR_SHRINKING is 1. 
	This is good for a tree which are nearly spherical itself, but if you want to 
	create a long, thin tree you may adjust the lateral shrinking by setting a lower 
	value. 
	So, for example 0.5 lets happen the lateral shrinking twice as fast as the 
	shrinking towards the top of the tree.

VERTICAL_SCAR_SHRINKING
	In addition to the previous point you can stretch the shrinking in vertical 
	direction.
	
SCAR_DEPTH
	In addition to the last points for the grain of the bark SCAR_DEPTH is a value 
	for a normal, which simulates a three-dimensional appearance with the same 
	width, height and turbulence as the grain has.

PALM_TRUNK
	Look at the palmtree. It has a "real" bark in horizontal direction. 1 produces 
	a very gnarled horizontal oriented bark (Use also the TRUNK_STRENGTH to influence 
	the appearance). 0 disables the palm-trunk-bark.
	The birch for example, has a little PALM_TRUNK-value too which reduces the smooth 
	appearance. If you want a "real" bark in vertical direction you find the 
	possibility in the next point. In this case PALM_TRUNK must be set to 0, 
	otherwise the following BARK_PROFILE is disabled for the trunk.

BARK_PROFILE
	PALM_TRUNK must be 0 to enable this feature for the trunk.
	In addition to the TRUNK_COLORs and SCAR_DEPTH the BARK_PROFILE is a "real" bark.
	Use also the TRUNK_STRENGTH to influence the appearance. If you have a full 
	BARK_PROFILE-value of 1	it may be necessary to increase the TRUNK_STRENGTH
	(perhaps up to 5 or more).

BRANCH_BARK_PROFILE_CHANGE
	It depends on BARK_PROFILE for the trunk and allows to adjust the influence 
	on the branches. It's a factor and if the value is 1 the branches have the same 
	BARK_PROFILE as the trunk (in this case I fear you have to increase the 
	BRANCH_STRENGTH, may be up to 5 or more). 
	In any case the amount of BARK_PROFILE decreases automatically towards the end 
	of the branches.

BRANCH_BARK_PROFILE_TAPER_OFF
	AS I said above, the BARK_PROFILE for the branch decreases automatically towards 
	its end. To change where this transition should happen you may increase or 
	decrease this value. Default is 1.

ROOT_BARK_PROFILE_CHANGE
	It depends on BARK_PROFILE for the trunk and allows to adjust the influence 
	on the roots. It's a factor and if the value is 1 the roots have the same 
	BARK_PROFILE as the trunk. (I think you have to increase the ROOT_STRENGTH too).

BOTTOM_COLOR_1
BOTTOM_COLOR_2
	Choose two RGB-values for the play of colors in the lower region of the 
	foliage.

TOP_COLOR_1
TOP_COLOR_2
	Choose two RGB-values for the play of colors in the upper region of the 
	foliage.

COLOR_TURB
	Set the turbulence for the play of foliage-colors in lower and upper regions. 

TRANSITION_BOTTOM_TOP
	This value determines in which height the lower colors and thus the transition 
	to the upper colors take place. The TOP_COLORs take place at the top of the 
	tree anyway. If the center of the BOTTOM_COLORs should be at the bottom/origin 
	(the ground) of the tree the TRANSITION_BOTTOM_TOP-value should be 0. If the 
	center of the BOTTOM_COLORs should be in the middle of the tree than set 0.5, 
	and so on...

TRANSITION_TURB
	To avoid a straight transition of BOTTOM_- and TOP_COLORs you may increase 
	the TRANSITION_TURB. It's a turbulence as you know it. 

FOLIAGE_GLOSS
	It's a phong-value to get less or more glossy leaves.
